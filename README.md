# date connor today [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fconnordennison%2Fdate-connor-today&env=DETA_PROJECT_KEY)
## why did i make this again??

### how to do the thing
1. Create a [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account
2. Create a [deta](https://deta.sh) account
3. Get your deta project key (it should appear on screen, I recommend creating a new project for this)
4. Click the deploy with Vercel button at the top of this markdown file - it will open a new page letting you (surprise surprise) deploy the project to Vercel.
5. In that page there will be a box asking for your deta token. This will allow the project to use deta base to store entries.
6. Click the thing that says something like deploy
7. Change the domain (optional) by going to the project settings and linking your domain. This is just general use of Vercel so I won't go into specifics.

### contributing
**tbh there's not really a point to contributing to this repo.** This was a site I made just for laughs because I bought [a funny domain](https://dateconnor.today).

You can still feel free to contribute, and I'll probably look at contributions, but **95% of PRs won't be merged**.

### what to do if i broke something (and you really care about this repo)
